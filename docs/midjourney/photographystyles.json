				"title": "Use a diffuser",
				"description": "It has a purpose that’s very important for indoor photographs and that’s evenly spreading the light. From there, we have two variants of diffusers – softbox and umbrella diffuser."
			},
			{
				"title": "Softbox diffuser",
				"description": "It’s usually the most used solution, producing the best results overall. It’s also quite bigger than an umbrella diffuser, but with much better light diffusion, thanks to a reflecting silver layer. On the contrary, this is a more expensive option and to put it to best use, you should have two of them."
			},
			{
				"title ": "Umbrella diffuser ",
				"description": "It's less robust, it’s easier to carry around, and still does a decent job. It works in a whole different way. The light is pointed towards the inner side of the umbrella, reflecting back of the inner side. Since the light has the freedom to “move” outside of the umbrella, the amount of light scattered is increased. You can, however, compensate for it by bringing it closer to the subject."
			},
			{
				"title": "Use Remote Flash Triggers",
				"description": "Many professional photographers use wireless flash triggers and for a reason. It’s much more reliable and decreases the chance of physical obstructions preventing it from working properly. Just connect your transmitter to the flash shoe on your camera and your receiver to the studio flash. Now you’re ready to go!"
			},
			{
				"title": "Use Reflectors",
				"description": "Having to shoot your photos without the reflector is like having to drink a hot beer. You can still drink it, but the taste is just awful. Reflectors are vastly used in studios around the world and they are here to brighten up the shadows. Furthermore, photographers use it to reflect the light onto the subject, which can also be a handy option. The main thing is that there are tons of different reflectors, varying in shape, size, and color. Still, buying a few of them shouldn’t be an expensive investment. And they are important for making the best use of the light."
			},
			{
				"title": "Get the Right Lens",
				"description": "If you have a DSLR or a mirrorless camera, swapping lenses is easier than saying “cheese”. Well, there are tons of lenses out there, each of them having a significant impact on the quality of your studio shots. For example, a wide-angle lens (20mm) is great for capturing a wide angle of view. On the contrary, there is a telephoto lens which can go up to 100mm, and this one captures a narrow field of view. But, what lens is perfect for studio photography? (On our website you can find lists of the best lenses for Nikon, Canon, Sony and Olympus cameras) In my experience, the best option is everything between 50mm and 200mm (check Recommended Gear page for all options depending on your camera brand). As you see it all depends on the studio photography type. For action photography, you need to go even higher 300mm or less. There is no ideal lens that you can buy it all depends on what type of studio photography you specialize in."
